    "### Standardizing Company Names\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to clean Company names for this dataset, Big Local News used a tool called OpenRefine. OpenRefine allows you to cluster text based on similarities in spelling. There are a number of algorithms available for clustering, such as `Key Collision - Fingerprint`, `Key Collision - metaphone3`, and `Nearest Neighbor - Levenshtein`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We used all of the algorithms to standardize company names and replace several different spellings of companies with a more unified spelling. The column `Parent Company` holds the original company names. In the column `Company Affiliation`, we use the algorithms available in open refine to make sure we have the same spellings for all company names.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within our data, we found many records that have a company name but are doing business as a different company name. For these records, we split the text on `DBA` which stands for `Doing Business As`. We then used the text before the ***DBA*** as the parent company name. That name is represented in the `Company Affiliation` column. We then used the text after the ***DBA*** in the `DBA` column. Any records without the text `DBA` were left untouched and appear as the same text in both columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to replacing parent company names within the `Company Affiliation` column, we also went through the text facet in OpenRefine and manually updated any parent company names that did not show up in any of the initial clusters. "
