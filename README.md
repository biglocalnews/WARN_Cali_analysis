## Californiaâ€™s layoffs and closures of 2019 and 2020 by Big Local News

The coronavirus pandemic disrupted the lives and livelihoods of many people in 2020. COVID-19 impacted everything from education, food supply, health care to the job market and housing. In our evictions story, we look at how pressure on renters during the pandemic resulted in evictions and how layoffs contributed to an already unstable housing situation for many.

This repository shares the data about layoffs and closures in california from 2019-2020. Layoffs and closures have always been a consistent presence in the market place. For the purposes of our story, we analyzed the 2019 data and compared it to 2020 data, in order to assess the difference in job losses from a non-pandemic year to a pandemic year. 

For the purposes of this story, we've only done specific analyses on counties with high rent burdens and public housing authorities. There are many patterns present in this data we have yet to explore and we are sharing it with the hopes that other data journalists and news organizations will report similar stories of their own - and share their counties and cities have been impacted by layoffs and closures.
